.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the NFSv4 ID <-> name mapping daemon.  It provides functionality to
the NFSv4 kernel client and server, to which it communicates via
upcalls, by translating user and group IDs to names, and vice versa.
.Pp
The system derives the
.Em user
part of the string by performing a password or group lookup.
The lookup mechanism is configured in
.Pa /etc/idmapd.conf
.Pp
By default, the
.Em domain
part of the string is the system's DNS domain name.
It can also be specified in
.Pa /etc/idmapd.conf
if the system is multi-homed,
or if the system's DNS domain name does
not match the name of the system's Kerberos realm.
.Pp
When the domain is not specified in /etc/idmapd.conf
the local DNS server will be queried for the 
.Sy _nfsv4idmapdomain 
text record. If the record exists
that will be used as the domain. When the record
does not exist, the domain part of the DNS domain
will used. 
.Pp
Note that on more recent kernels only the NFSv4 server uses
.Nm .
The NFSv4 client instead uses
.Xr nfsidmap 8 ,
and only falls back to 
.Nm 
if there was a problem running the
.Xr nfsidmap 8
program.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds_imagedir
.It Fl h
Display usage message.
.It Fl v
Increases the verbosity level (can be specified multiple times).
.It Fl f
Runs
.Nm
in the foreground and prints all output to the terminal.
.It Fl p Ar path
Specifies the location of the RPC pipefs to be
.Ar path .
The default value is \&"/var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs\&".
.It Fl c Ar path
Use configuration file
.Ar path .
This option is deprecated.
.It Fl C
Client-only: perform no idmapping for any NFS server, even if one is detected.
.It Fl S
Server-only: perform no idmapping for any NFS client, even if one is detected.
